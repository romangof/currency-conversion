## Workflow

Started on Sat 16.11  
Spent around 2 hours setting a first version with a basic template  
Had an issue with Material UI theme as I wanted to use a gradient, and couldn't do it they way I wanted so decided not to  
Tried using fetch to make the request to the API, but quite soon remembered how annoying fetch can be and decided to use axios  
Had some issues setting the source currency as I wanted to make only one request, this took me a while to realize  
On Sunday I started around noon and quite soon made my mind that it was easier/faster to just make a couple more requests than trying to calculate all of the rates between the different currencies  
On Sunday afternoon I spent the most time trying to setup unit tests

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run lint`

Launches the eslint runner <br />

### `npm run lint:fix`

Launches the eslint runner in fix mode <br />
